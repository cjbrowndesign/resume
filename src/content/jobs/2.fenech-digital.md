My primary job role at Fenech Digital/Kappow was a front-end web developer, specializing in crafting bespoke WordPress themes for a diverse clientele, from SMEs to large corporates. Collaborating closely with either our in-house designer or external agencies, I seamlessly translated designs from Sketch and Photoshop into fully responsive, accessible, and high-performing websites. My responsibilities encompassed the complete build process, including responsive design, bug fixing, QA, and post-launch adjustments.

Notable challenges and achievements during my time are as follows:

- Development of a bespoke WordPress Framework for use by all company developers to ensure consistency across all projects.

- Custom SASS Mixins, Functions and Variables to aid in the swift development of projects.

- Custom WordPress helper functions for a more streamlined development process.

- Responsible for performance testing and optimisation of all projects. Utilising tools such as Google Lighthouse and Pingdom to identify areas of improvement and implement updates.

- Adapting to the needs of the business, including working on projects outside of my usual skillset.

- Facilitated effective communication channels between clients and the development team for improved feedback and revisions.

- Onboarding and training of new developers, ensuring they are familiar with the company development processes and standards.

- Project Managament, including the creation of project plans, timelines and budgets. Assisting clients by providing technical advice and guidance.
